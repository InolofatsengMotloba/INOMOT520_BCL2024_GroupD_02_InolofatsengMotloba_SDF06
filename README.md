## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I recreated a simplified version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I feel confident in creating a cohisive color scheme/theme. 
- **Responsive Design**: I implemented media queries by replicating other codes. Source: George W. Park (CodePen)
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style some images but I had to check through my notes.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I found adjusting layouts for smaller screens difficult to understand. I had to ask for help from other students.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I felt confident implementing these interactive elements as I have already practiced them on previous projects.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I need to practice my advanced CSS properties and animations more because I relied on other resources and peers more.
- **Code Optimization**: My work is satisfactory but I know I can do better.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I used the current instagram profile as reference but did not achieve the desired outcome I wanted.

#### Overall Learning Experience
This project was challenging for me mostly because I didn't manage my time well.
